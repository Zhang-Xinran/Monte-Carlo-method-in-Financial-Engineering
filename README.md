# Monte Carlo method in Financial Engineering
## Goal
To investigate variance reduction methods
commonly used in Monte Carlo simulation including Control Variate Methods and Importance
Sampling. Euler schemes for simulating diffusion processes are introduced. The usage of Monte Carlo methods in solving financial modelling problems are introduced.

## Methods
Plain Monte Carlo methods, control variate methods, and importance sampling are applied to
estimate the option price of several types of options, including call option, put option, discretely
monitored average price option, binary option, butterfly spread option, straddle option, with
the underlying stock price following Geometric Brownian motion.
